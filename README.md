# DDR_CS
Differential Drive Robot Control Structure for ECE 370.

pipython.py is to be run on the Raspberry Pi, allowing back-and-forth UDP communication between the Pi
and the microcontroller.

DDR_CS.ino was the original source code of the first submission for this project.


Once the submission criteria changed, three different versions of the original code were used to showcase
each function that needed to be demonstrated, each listed ast TEST_X_NAME.
